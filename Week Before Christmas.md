# The Week Before Christmas

```text
'Twas the week before Christmas
    And all through the labs
The students were sweating
    And coding like mad.

With nary a nap,
    Caffine in their veins,
And tears in their eyes,
    Unbelievable pains.

I was in my office
    Awaiting to mark
And perked up my ears
    As I heard a shriek "Hark!"

I ran to the lab
    To find out the matter
Beginning to worry
    At the sound of a clatter.

I burst in the room
    And stopped in my tracks
And stared at the students
    Erupting in claps.

The joy in their faces
    Relief in their eyes
Their program was working
    They let out great sighs.

They looked up at me
    And beamed with a smile,
"We got it to run!
    It took us a while!"

"Then zip up the files,
    You've got just an hour
To write up the docs!"
    Their faces went sour.

I went to my office
    And let slip a smirk,
"I spoiled their fun;
    I am such a jerk!"

In a short while
    Their lab finally in,
I opened it up
    Expecting to grin.

They knocked on my door
    To say a "Goodbye!"
Giving each other
    A bunch of high-fives.

I glanced at their code
    and froze in great fright.
The light slowly dawned
    "'Twill be a long night."
